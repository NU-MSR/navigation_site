You are designing a finite state machine for a robotic vacuum cleaner that must vacuum itself and return
to its charging station when it is low on batteries. The robot starts at its charging station with a full charge.
When a user presses a button, the robot will start cleaning, if the robot is more than 75% charged.
If the robot is less than 25% charged, it will return to the charging station.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>What states does the robot have?</li>
<li>What are the events?</li>
<li>Draw a state-transition diagram for the robot</li>
<li>Implement a ROS node that models the robot:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When the robot is charging, it prints "Charging" and the power level</li>
<li>When the robot is vacuuming it prints "Vacuuming" and the power level</li>
<li>When the robot is returning to charge it prints "Returning" and the power level</li>
<li>Messages are printed once every 1 second</li>
<li>The battery charges at a rate of 10% per second</li>
<li>The battery discharges at a rate of 10% per second when vacuuming and 5% when returning</li>
<li>The robot always makes it back to the charging station when the battery is at 10% remaining</li>
<li>The user calls a "start" service to cause the robot to start vacuuming, if it has enough charge
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The service can be a <code>std_srvs::Empty</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
